Title: R Interface for US EPA's SWMM
Description: Functions to connect the widely used Storm Water Management Model (SWMM)
  of the United States Environmental Protection Agency (US EPA) 
  <https://www.epa.gov/water-research/storm-water-management-model-swmm> to R with
  currently two main goals: (1) Run a SWMM simulation from R and (2) provide fast 
  access to simulation results, i.e. SWMM's binary '.out'-files. High performance is achieved
  with help of Rcpp. Additionally, reading SWMM's '.inp'-files is supported to 
  glance model structures.
